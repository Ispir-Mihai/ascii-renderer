# ASCII Renderer

## Overview

This is a work-in-progress ASCII renderer designed to create and display 3D graphics in a console environment. The renderer supports basic primitives such as quads and cubes, utilizes backbuffering for smooth rendering, and employs triangle rendering with indexed vertices, similar to OpenGL. The project also includes shading techniques to enhance the visual output.

## Features

- **Primitives**: Renders quad and cube primitives.
- **Tris Rendering**: Uses indexed triangles for efficient rendering.
- **Backbuffering**: Implements a backbuffering technique.

## Installation

To run the ASCII renderer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascii-renderer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd ascii-renderer

3. Compile the source code (adjust based on your build system):

   make

4. Run the renderer:

   ./ascii-renderer

## Usage

The renderer is designed to be used in a console environment. There is no usage documentation since the project is at its beginning.

## WIP (Work in Progress)

This project is currently a work in progress, and future enhancements will include:

- Improved shading
- Additional primitive support
- Optimizations for performance
- Lighting
- Depth buffer
